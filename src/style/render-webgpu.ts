// Native WebGPU/TSL render path (the `webgpu` branch port).

// Replaces the stopgap direct renderer.render() in render-target.ts's WebGPU
// branch with Three's node-based RenderPipeline (formerly PostProcessing): the
// scene renders through a PassNode at the PSX low-res scale, then composites to
// the screen. This restores the low-res fill win the classic pipeline got from
// its 0.4× lowResTarget — without it the WebGPU path was rendering full-res.
//
// The PSX look (palette / dither / depth-crush / bloom / inscatter) gets chained
// onto outputNode as TSL effect nodes incrementally — see WEBGPU-MIGRATION.md.
// For now outputNode is the raw scene pass (so it renders correctly, just
// without the post look yet).
